# Workflow

This project was managed using the git workflow:  

The team maintains one development branch that is fed by feature branches. Ready to deploy features undergo the following agile process:

1. Feature branch is rebased to consolidate commit history and ensure only working code is pushed to the dev branch.
2. Feature branch is pushed to project repo. 
3. A pull request is made with another dev tagged for review.
4. Developer branch is merged in line with agile methodology.
